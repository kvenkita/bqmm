# Number of observations used in the fit

Number of observations used in the fit

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'bqmm'
nobs(object, ...)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  A `bqmm` fit.

- ...:

  Unused.

## Value

An integer, the number of observations.

## Examples

``` r
# \donttest{
fit <- bqmm(distance ~ age + (1 | Subject), data = nlme::Orthodont,
            tau = 0.5, chains = 1, iter = 300, refresh = 0, seed = 1)
#> Warning: The largest R-hat is 1.07, indicating chains have not mixed.
#> Running the chains for more iterations may help. See
#> https://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#r-hat
#> Warning: Bulk Effective Samples Size (ESS) is too low, indicating posterior means and medians may be unreliable.
#> Running the chains for more iterations may help. See
#> https://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#bulk-ess
#> Warning: Tail Effective Samples Size (ESS) is too low, indicating posterior variances and tail quantiles may be unreliable.
#> Running the chains for more iterations may help. See
#> https://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#tail-ess
#> Warning: Some Rhat > 1.01; chains may not have converged.
#> Warning: Some effective sample sizes < 100; consider more iterations.
